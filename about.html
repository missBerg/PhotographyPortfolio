		<h1 class="c1p-h1">ABOUT</h1>

		<p>My name is Dorota Ebert, and I love creating custom photo sessions for maternity, newborn, children, and families - capturing the magic before the moment passes…</p>

		<p class="c1p-text-emphasis">My biggest joy is to present you those precious moments as stunning photographs that you and your family will cherish forever.</p>
		
		<p>For maternity and newborn, it’s like the first chapter of an amazing journey you are on. With children and families, it’s all about creating a wonderful snapshot in time which is encapsulated in a frame or album. It's for you to share and enjoy with friends and family.</p>

		<p>It all began over 10 years ago, when I started capturing real, everyday moments of joy of friends I love, and the children of families I worked for.</p>

		<p>Since my late teens I have been a nanny working with amazing families in the USA and UK, and my passion for photography grew ever since I started working with children.</p>
